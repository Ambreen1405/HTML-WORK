                <li><b><u><i>Red Dead Redemption 2.</i></u></b><br><br>
                    Not sure where you got your info but its fairly wrong. Whites were there. Kids and adults were there. Cowboys were real. So were gangs and lawmen. Of course much was likely embellished by writers and people telling the stories.

Your friends and you decide to take a road trip. You call "Shotgun" meaning front passenger seat. Why? Because that is from the stagecoach days where the second rider up top literally had a rifle or more often a shotgun to protect the coach and its passengers and cargo. Real facts.

No game is historically accurate. Nobody would play it. Every game that attempts any sort of historical accuracy does so with lots of compromises.

If you want historical accuracy, watch a Ken Burns documentary, otherwise, suspend reality and enjoy the game for what it is. A game.

The land isn't real. Though its fairly realistically rendered and decorated from southern swamps to northern snowy mountain passes. Many animal behaviors are realistic. Beyond that, there is almost nothing real or historically accurate in the game. It has an aire of realism thats entertaining to most. But if you are looking for a history class on the west, this ain't it. And I don't think there is one.

                <li><b><u><i>Minecraft.</i></u></b><br><br>
                    So I'm new here, but I have a big theory. I have a buddy whose brother came up with a seriously good theory for Minecraft history. He came up with it and put it on a google doc. any way, here go's:

Minecraft is a simple game. The entire game revolves around the game's main character, “Steve”. You play as Steve for an indefinite amount of time. The end goal of the game is to have killed the “Ender Dragon”, the game's final boss. There are smaller bosses, like the “Wither” and “Warden”, but the game “ends” when you kill the Ender Dragon. Really, the game never ends, but you see the end scenes after you kill the Ender Dragon.

It seems like a fairly peaceful game, despite the hostile mobs, but if we look at the worlds around us in the game, we see that there was obviously a larger thing that happened in the game. The games “history” if you will. If we look at the game's mobs, we can tell what happened.

For starters there's the “Undead '' mobs. These mobs have no similarities to any other mob other than you, steve. The “Illigers” and “Villagers” have longer heads and noses, whereas the “Zombies” and “Skeletons” have a more square head, exactly like Steves. This means that at one point in the history of this world, there was a sickness, apocalypse, etc. There was a whole civilization of “Steves” that got wiped out by themselves, or their zombies.
                <img src="../img/m game.png" alt="Games"></li><br><br>
                <li><b><u><i>Grand Theft Auto V.</i></u></b><br><br>
                    Very accurate. According to this feature (How gang members helped make Grand Theft Auto 5), the game developers interviewed actual gang members when making the games. So the way GTA V characters acted and spoke mirror these real-world people.

But I won't say "perfectly accurate" because I don't know the demographic of those chosen for the interviews. For example, if all of them are from US, it would be accurate for the gang life of US but it may not be the case in other countries. Other than this minor point, though, I'm kinda impressed with the amount of work put for this game.
                <img src="../img/g game.jpg" alt="Games"></li><br><br>
                <li><b><u><i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</i></u></b><br><br>
                    Skyrim is 100% fantasy in a fictional World.

It doesn't matter if there is any similarities to our own real world history, a fantasy can be whatever you want it to be, it doesn't have to follow any particular rule.

There was no Dragons, Elves, Orcs, Dwarves, Daedra, Aedra, Magic, Goblins, Ebony Ore, or things like soul gems in our history.

Even the Dark Elves or Dwemer used mushroom trees as homes, they used Stilt Striders (massive bugs) as a means of travel, and their government is accepting of organizations that deal in public displays of murder.

The imperials designed after Romans, but behave far differently from Romans. Nords are like Vikings in technology and clothing style, but they are heavily against taking slaves and pillaging for wealth - their beliefs in the afterlife is similar to Valhalla but every Nord goes there.

There is thousands of differences between real world history and their own.

The only time a game should be judged for historical accuracy is if it is based on the real world and using real world history, like EA Games' Battlefield.

But judging The Elder Scrolls games in terms of real world historical accuracy is like doing the same thing to Star Wars.
